            <p> I've spent the last two days frantically doing everything that's optional and nothing that's necessary. 
              I've rock climbed whenever I wanted to, I played five games of pool last night, I drank Barefoot and cleaned my entire
              house. It's been a nice week. </p>
              <p>That brings me to the present moment. I'm splayed out over two benches in the arrivals section of the Raleigh-Durham 
              International airport, my packed bags littered around my lounging self. I'm going to Copenhagen for a study abroad program today, and I have to build a website before I get there. Hah. I wonder how long 
              that'll take. I'm not stressed. I should emphasize the fact that I really am <em>lounging</em> in this Starbucks. Read this: 
              socks and sandals, baby. It's 2019. I don't have time for pinched pinky toes. </p>
              <p>A fanny pack. Laugh, yes, but please picture yourself
              rummaging through your cavernous pockets for your boarding pass, passport, iPhone charger, iPhone, mint gum; your cargo shorts weighed down to the floor in a way
              that would make Antoine Dodson smile, a sad state of affairs. You can see the future. Make of that how you will. Now picture <em>me</em>; tribal patterned fanny pack at-waist, posted up at the front
              of the boarding line; wielding my documents with <em>finesse</em>. This is how you pack and prepare for international travel. </p>
              <p>You man wishes that he 
              bought his suitcase for four dollars. Your man wishes he was living off Pop-Chips and RxBars. International Travel baby, he's the most International
              Man in The World. Thank you. Welcome to my #blog.</p>
