            <h2 class="post-title">How to pack for International Travel</h2>
            <p class='post-timestamp'>May 18, 2019</p>
            <p> I've spent the last two days frantically doing everything that's optional and nothing that's necessary. 
              I've rock climbed whenever I wanted to, I played five games of pool just last night, I drank Barefoot and cleaned my entire
              house. I slept in consistently 'til noon. It's been a really nice week. </p>
              <p>That being said, my cavalier attitude towards life has consistently pushed pressing matters to the back of my agenda. I'm going abroad and I didn't pack until this morning. I've got a website to build in two days, but more on that later. Currently, I'm splayed out over two benches in the arrivals section of the Raleigh-Durham 
              International airport, my packed bags littered around my lounging self. I'm boarding a flight to Copenhagen for three weeks- speeding towards a study-abroad program focused on the poetic beauty and nuance of the world-wide-web.
              Hence, the website. Two days to complete. Hah. I wonder how long it'll actually take.
              I'm not stressed. I want to emphasize the fact that I really am <em>lounging</em> in this Starbucks. Scrunch your eyes shut and picture it. 
              None of my clothes are skin-tight. I'm taking up more space than Cheaper by the Dozen would. Turkey jerky in-hand.
              Baseball hat crooked. Read this: socks and sandals. Whoa. Baby, it's 2019. You should know I don't have time for pinched pinky toes. </p>
              <p>A fanny pack. Will you look at that, the boy's sporting the holy grail of the Epcot dad. Laugh, yes, but please picture your miserable life without it.
              At the gate, rummaging through your cavernous pockets for boarding passes, passport, iPhone charger, iPhone, mint gum; your cargo shorts weighed down to the floor in a way
              that would make Antoine Dodson smile; truly a sad state of affairs. Now picture <em>me</em>; tribal patterned fanny pack at-waist, posted up at the front
              of the boarding line; wielding my documents with <em>finesse</em>. Kids listen to your father: this is how you pack and prepare for international travel. </p>
              
              <p>You dad wishes that he 
              bought his suitcase for four dollars. Your dad wishes he was living off Pop-Chips and RxBars. Show your dad this blog so he can
              post it on his work Slack. International Travel baby, I'm the most International
              Man in The World. Thank you. Welcome to my #blog.</p>
