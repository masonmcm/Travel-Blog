But I'm changed. It's something I've dreamed about for my entire life: years of effort have culminated in an event that\n              has grown to define me as an international traveler. A bottle of shampoo exploded in my suitcase. Tragedy strikes! Now before you all jump down\n              my throat questioning my aptitude in properly packing toiletries, take a moment to consider my feelings. Situations like \n              this might bring the most seasoned travelers to their knees, and I am no exception. I am but a man. And the shampoo was this \n              industrial-grade dandruff shampoo too, so it made my clothes smell terrible.</p>\n\n              <p>But I'm over it. I did laundry and the stains are all but erased. My shirts smell fine now. Things are looking up!</p>\n\n              <p>Yesterday I checked off two boxes from my itinerary when I woke up in a hostel and visited Kris in the Royal Danish Library after lunch. \n              You may call me anything but inefficient. This morning the study abroad group shouldered our jet-lag and yawned our way out of the dormitory. \n              In Copenhagen during rush-hour, you'll see hordes of bikers pouring through the intersections like the swarms of ants in that Indiana Jones \n              movie. I almost wept it was so beautiful. I should mention: I'm enamored with biking. You'll hear about this more after our guided bike tour tomorrow. \n              (!) Anyways, our group traipsed through city center towards a converted-circus tent where our study-abroad progam was to be kicked off. It was cool but what \n              interested me is that Magnus Carlsson will be at the same venue tomorrow night. A world-famous chess player will entertain an auditorium for an entire headlining performance. \n              By playing chess... I guess? That could be boring. Hmmm, but what else would he do? I dunno. Chess is pretty cool. I'd watch that.</p>\n              \n              <p>Well this is disorganized. I think this is supposed to be a travel blog, but I turned it into a diary disguised as an advice column. \n              This is whatever you want it to be. <em>This is a sign from the heavens. Quit your job and move to Copenhagen.</em> I met someone in the hostel who did something \n              similar, actually. Her name was Anna, she worked 85 hours a week at a non-profit in Santa Cruz before moving to Spain and becoming an English-language teacher. Now she works \n              25 hours a week and travels when she wants to. That's my advice for the day: be like Anna. Listen to your gut, but also listen to me. Anna made pretty life-changing moves \n              at the age of 29 so you can do it whenever the hell you want to. Go out there and get that cultural knowledge! #blog #advice #blog_guy</p>\n            <p></p>\n        </article>\n\n        <article class=\"post\">\n          <h2 class=\"post-title\">How to pack for International Travel</h2>\n          <p class=\"post-timestamp\">May 18, 2019</p>\n          <p> I've spent the last two days frantically doing everything that's optional and nothing that's necessary. \n            I've rock climbed whenever I wanted to, I played five games of pool just last night, I drank Barefoot and cleaned my entire\n            house. I slept in consistently 'til noon. It's been a really nice week. </p>\n            <p>That being said, my cavalier attitude towards life has consistently pushed pressing matters to the back of my agenda. I'm going abroad and I didn't pack until this morning. I've got a website to build in two days, but more on that later. Currently, I'm splayed out over two benches in the arrivals section of the Raleigh-Durham \n            International airport, my packed bags littered around my lounging self. I'm boarding a flight to Copenhagen for three weeks- speeding towards a study-abroad program focused on the poetic beauty and nuance of the world-wide-web.\n            Hence, the website. Two days to complete. Hah. I wonder how long it'll actually take.\n            I'm not stressed. I want to emphasize the fact that I really am <em>lounging</em>. Scrunch your eyes shut and picture it. \n            None of my clothes are skin-tight. I'm taking up more space than the family from Cheaper by the Dozen. I'm eating well: turkey jerky in-hand.\n            Baseball hat is tipped. Read this: socks and sandals. Whoa. Baby, it's 2019. You should know I don't have time for pinched pinky toes. </p>\n            <p>A fanny pack. Will you look at that, the boy's sporting the holy grail of the Epcot dad. Laugh, yes, but please picture your miserable life without it.\n            At the gate, rummaging through your cavernous pockets for boarding passes, passport, iPhone charger, iPhone, mint gum; your cargo shorts weighed down to the floor in a way\n            that would make Antoine Dodson smile; truly a sad state of affairs. Now picture <em>me</em>; tribal patterned fanny pack at-waist, posted up at the front\n            of the boarding line; wielding my documents with <em>finesse</em>. Kids listen to your father: this is how you pack and prepare for international travel. </p>\n            \n            <p>You dad wishes that he \n            bought his suitcase for four dollars. Your dad wishes he was living off Pop-Chips and RxBars. Show your dad this blog so he can\n            post it on his work Slack. International Travel baby, I'm the most International\n            Man in The World. Thank you.
